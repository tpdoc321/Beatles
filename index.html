  <p>After hours of subjective deliberation, I mean... after months of scientific research, the 5 choices below are (in no particular order) the top 5 Beatles songs according to myself... err... science.</p>

  <h2><u><b>I'm Only Sleeping</u> (1966)</b></h2>
  <img src="img/revolverbeatles.jpg" height="350" width="350" alt="Revolver Album Cover"/>
  <p><b>A lethargic, beautiful song with impeccable harmonies, a backwards guitar solo and one of McCartney's best bass lines. John sounds exhausted. Perfect song.</b></p>

  <h2><u><b>Dear Prudence</u> (1968)</b></h2>
  <img src="img/Dear_prudence_sheet_music_1.png" height="350" width="350" alt="Dear Prudence Cover"/>
  <p><b>Written by John while in India to help Mia Farrow's sister Prudence with her depression, this song includes gorgeous finger picking, buoyant and inventive bass lines, fantastic guitar harmonies by George, heavy drums played by Paul (Ringo had quit the band at this time) and one of the most affecting and uplifting codas in music. Go listen now.</b></p>

  <h2><u><b>Happiness Is A Warm Gun</u> (1968)</b></h2>
  <img src="img/whitealbum.jpg" height="350" width="350"/>
  <p><b>A song in several parts, this pop epic includes an incredible John vocal performance (e.g. the final high note at the end), surreal lyrics, some heavy guitar riffs and odd time signatures. This song shows the Beatles as a rock and roll band.</b></p>

  <h2><u><b>Revolution (Hard Rock Version)</u> (1968)</b></h2>
  <img src="img/beatles-revolution.jpg" height="350" width="350"/>
  <p><b>Originally released as a slower, acoustic version on The White Album, this hard rocking version of the tune was released as the B side to the "Hey Jude" single. Featuring the same lyrics (with one small, notable change), this version of the song includes heavily distorted guitars, an impassioned Lennon vocal and thunderous drums. Definitely one of the best and most rocking Beatles tunes.</b></p>
